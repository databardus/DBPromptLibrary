# DBPromptLibrary
An educational repo for those looking to use generative AI that uses a database as context.
It is intended to be a learning tool to help you understand how to build your own prompts,
and certain approaches you can use to make prompts organized and reusable.

By no means is this repo intended to be 'plug and play' for production use cases. Each LLM used
with these prompts may generate different results, and you should always validate the output of any LLM
before using it in a production environment.

## Repository Structure
In general, the repo is organized into folders with specific prompt use cases in each folder.

## Prompt Structure
Each prompt is organized into a markdown file with the following structure:
- Goal: A brief description of what the prompt is intended to achieve.
- Parameters: A list of parameters that the prompt accepts.
- Prompt: The actual prompt text that can be used with an LLM.

This is a resource I provide to the community free of charge, in hopes it helps you learn
how to interact with LLMs in the context of databases.
If you have any suggestions, improvements, or would like to contribute, please feel free to open a PR or an issue.
